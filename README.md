**Sapelo2018**

This project was conducted as a part of a field course through University of Wisconsin-Madison.

All data were collected in Sapelo Island, Georgia between October 19 and 26 2018.

The goal of the project was to determine the relationship between the epizoic algal biomass, their environment, and their host snail (*Littorina irrorata*) behavior in a tidal salt marsh.


`Data` folder containing all data used in analyses
 * `Botsch_Sapelo_Snail_MASTER.xlsx` excel file containing all data collected in the field and data about snails 	
 *  all csv files beginning with `NDVI` contain the ENDVI values produced from the photos, using the `IRprocessing.R` files.
 
 
 `Analysis` 
 * 	`IRProcessing.R` script where channel values are extracted from photos and ENDVI is calculated	
 *  `Snail_clean.R` script where all analyses are conducted.
